    <h2>✨ The Moment I Knew</h2>
    <p>She was so warm, so soft. As I cradled her in my arms, she let out the faintest sigh, curling up as if she already knew she was safe. I looked into her half-lidded eyes, feeling the tiniest of purrs vibrate against my chest, and whispered, <strong class="highlight">"You're coming home with us, little one."</strong></p>

    <p>The shelter worker smiled as we filled out the paperwork, but I barely registered anything else around me. All I could focus on was the tiny heartbeat pressed against me, the way she nuzzled deeper into my arms. It didn’t feel like I was choosing her—it felt like she had chosen us. And in that moment, I knew: this was our cat, our Latte.</p>
