    <h2>🐱 A Surprise Date & A Dangerous Idea</h2>
    <p>It started as an ordinary day—an impromptu date planned by my boyfriend. I had no idea where we were going, just that he had a mischievous glint in his eye. When we finally arrived at a <strong class="highlight">kitty café</strong>, my heart nearly burst. The room was filled with soft purrs, playful paws, and curious little faces peeking around every corner. I was in heaven.</p>

    <p>We played with <strong class="highlight">so many cats</strong>, each one charming in their own way. Some were mischievous, some were cuddly, and some just lounged in sunbeams, completely unbothered. We laughed, we fawned over them, and we jokingly said, "Imagine if we took one home." But then, somehow, that joke turned into something else—a what if. And before we knew it, we made the <strong class="highlight">dangerous</strong> decision to visit a shelter. Just to look. Or at least, that’s what we told ourselves.</p>
