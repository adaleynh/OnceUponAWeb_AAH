    <h2>💖 Life with Latte</h2>
    <p>Every day, she fills our home with <strong class="highlight">love and mischief</strong>. From the moment she arrived, it was clear—this wasn’t just our home anymore. It was <em>hers</em>, and we were merely her loyal subjects.</p>
    
    <p>She wakes us up every morning, not with a gentle nuzzle, but with tiny paws pressing against our faces, demanding attention. Her favorite game? Knocking things off tables while staring directly into our eyes, as if daring us to stop her. And yet, despite her chaotic energy, she also has the softest, most heart-melting moments.</p>

    <p>Every day with Latte is an adventure. Whether she’s darting through the house at full speed at 3 AM, chasing imaginary enemies, or sitting by the window watching birds with an expression of deep, philosophical thought—she makes our lives infinitely better.</p>

    <p>We may have adopted her, but in truth, she’s the one who chose us. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
