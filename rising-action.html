        <h2>💕 Meeting Latte</h2>
        <p>The shelter was quiet, filled with tiny meows echoing through the space. We had been so sure—a tortie, that was the plan. But then, in the far corner, we spotted them—<strong class="highlight">two tiny ginger American Shorthairs</strong>, curled up in a sleepy little bundle. Their fur was soft, their bodies warm from napping, and for a moment, it felt like time slowed. I reached for one, but she <strong class="highlight">wiggled away</strong>, tucking herself deeper into the blankets. Her sister, however, didn’t move—just blinked up at me with the sleepiest eyes. The shelter worker gently placed her in my arms, and that was it. I felt her tiny heartbeat against my chest, her whiskers twitching as she adjusted in my hold. I didn’t need to say anything. I just knew—she was <strong class="highlight">the one</strong>.</p>
