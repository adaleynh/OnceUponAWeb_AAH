        <h2>🏡 Bringing Latte Home</h2>

       <p>The adoption papers were signed, my hands were shaking, and my heart was racing. I had dreamed of this moment for so long. I looked down at the tiny kitten curled in my arms—so small and sleepy, nestled like a warm bundle of fur. The car hummed softly as we drove, and every few minutes, I glanced down just to make sure she was real. Halfway home, she **stretched her tiny paws**, blinked her sleepy eyes, and let out the **smallest, squeakiest meow**. My heart melted.</p>

       <p>When we arrived, Latte sniffed the air, flicked her tiny tail, and cautiously stepped into her new home. She took a few slow steps, then, just like that, she flopped over in the middle of the floor and fell asleep again. My boyfriend and I exchanged glances and just laughed—it was already clear: this little creature ruled the house now.</p>
